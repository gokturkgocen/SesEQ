SesEQ also **bundles and depends on third-party components** that are **not** covered

## 1. Discogs-EffNet music-style classification model

**Component:** `Resources/DiscogsEffNet.mlmodelc` (compiled Core ML model, bundled and
redistributed in the app), together with its derived resources:
`Resources/discogs_styles.txt` (the 400-label style taxonomy), and — in the source
tree — `ml-pipeline/DiscogsEffNet.mlpackage`,
`ml-pipeline/discogs-effnet-bsdynamic-1.onnx`, and
`ml-pipeline/discogs-effnet-metadata.json`.

**Original model:** "Discogs-EffNet" / `EffnetDiscogs` (EfficientNet-B0), a music
style-classification and embedding model predicting the top-400 Discogs music styles.

**Authors / origin:** Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra (MTG-UPF),
Barcelona — Pablo Alonso-Jiménez, Xavier Serra, and Dmitry Bogdanov. Distributed as part
of the **Essentia** models collection.

**License:** **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International
(CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)** — https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/

**Source / homepage:** https://essentia.upf.edu/models.html

**Redistribution note:** `Resources/DiscogsEffNet.mlmodelc` is a **compiled derivative**
of the original Essentia model. It was produced by converting the upstream ONNX model
(`discogs-effnet-bsdynamic-1.onnx`) to Core ML via the pipeline in `ml-pipeline/`.
As a derivative work of a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 model, this compiled model — and any
application that bundles it — is itself licensed under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**: it may be
used and redistributed for **non-commercial purposes only**, **with attribution**, and
any distributed adaptation must be shared under the **same** license.

## 2. Essentia MusiCNN mel-spectrogram input recipe

**Component:** The mel-spectrogram feature-extraction recipe reproduced by
`Sources/MelSpectrogram.swift`, and the precomputed mel filterbank shipped as
`Resources/mel_filterbank_96x257.f32` (and, in the source tree,
`ml-pipeline/mel_filterbank_96x257.f32` / `.npy`, plus the self-test vectors
`selftest_input.f32` and `selftest_mel.f32`).

**Origin:** The input pipeline follows Essentia's `TensorflowInputMusiCNN` recipe — the
MusiCNN mel-spectrogram front-end that the Discogs-EffNet model expects (16 kHz mono →
frame 512 / hop 256 → Hann window → power spectrum → 96-band Slaney/`unit_tri` mel
filterbank → `log10(10000·x + 1)`). The Swift port was validated to be numerically
equivalent to Essentia's implementation.

**Authors / origin:** Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra (MTG-UPF), as
part of the **Essentia** open-source audio-analysis library
(https://essentia.upf.edu/). The MusiCNN front-end derives from the work of Jordi Pons
and Xavier Serra (MusiCNN).

**License / relationship:** The Essentia library is distributed under the
**GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0)**. SesEQ does **not** link against,
include, or redistribute Essentia or any Essentia source code — the Swift
implementation is an **independent, from-scratch reimplementation** of the documented
mel recipe (Accelerate/vDSP), written to match Essentia's numerical output. The mel
filterbank coefficients are a data artifact of that recipe. Essentia is used only
offline, in `ml-pipeline/` (validation scripts), to generate and verify these
artifacts; those scripts are dev-only and are not part of the shipped app.

## 3. Discogs style taxonomy (400 style labels)

**Component:** `Resources/discogs_styles.txt` — the ordered list of 400 music-style
labels in `Parent---Style` format (e.g. `Electronic---Deep House`), also embedded in the
model's output layer.

**Origin:** These labels are the **Discogs** community music-style taxonomy, as used to
train the Discogs-EffNet model. The label set is an integral part of the model's output
vocabulary and is redistributed here as part of the same CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 model derivative
described in section 1. "Discogs" is a service and trademark of Zink Media, LLC; the
taxonomy terms are used here only to name the model's output classes, and no affiliation
with or endorsement by Discogs is claimed.

## 4. Runtime web services (used at runtime, not redistributed)

The following services are queried over the network at runtime to resolve now-playing
metadata and per-artist/per-track genre. **No data or content from these services is
bundled in or redistributed with SesEQ**; the app is only an API client. Each service is
governed by its own terms of use. Users deploying or forking SesEQ are responsible for
complying with those terms and for supplying their own credentials where required.

- **MusicBrainz** — used via the MusicBrainz Web Service v2
  (`https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2`) to resolve an artist's community genre/tag votes.
  MusicBrainz **data** is released into the public domain / under permissive terms (core
  data is **CC0**; some supplementary data is **CC BY-NC-SA**). Use of the API requires a
  descriptive `User-Agent` header (SesEQ sends one identifying the app and its repo) and
  roughly ≤ 1 request/second, per the
  [MusicBrainz API policy](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API/Rate_Limiting).
  Anyone redistributing a fork should set a `User-Agent` identifying their own build.

- **Apple iTunes Search API** — used via `https://itunes.apple.com/search` to resolve a
  track's primary genre and to fetch album artwork. Subject to Apple's iTunes Search API
  terms and rate limits. Artwork and metadata are fetched on demand and displayed, not
  stored or redistributed. Apple, iTunes, and Apple Music are trademarks of Apple Inc.;
  no affiliation or endorsement is claimed.

- **Spotify Web API** — used for the currently-playing track and queue look-ahead only,
  via user-authorized OAuth (PKCE). Subject to the
  [Spotify Developer Terms](https://developer.spotify.com/terms). SesEQ ships **no**
  Spotify client credentials; a user must supply their own Client ID. Spotify content and
  metadata are not redistributed. Spotify is a trademark of Spotify AB; no affiliation is
  claimed.

- **YouTube Music** — read via the browser's own open `music.youtube.com` tab (page DOM
  read through AppleScript/JavaScript) to obtain the currently-playing title/artist. No
  YouTube/Google API is called and no content is redistributed; SesEQ only reads what is
  already displayed in the user's browser session. Subject to YouTube's and Google's Terms
  of Service. YouTube and YouTube Music are trademarks of Google LLC; no affiliation is
  claimed.

## 5. EQ baseline measurement data (Moondrop Chu II → Harman)

**Component:** The `chuIIBaseline` parametric-EQ filter set in `Sources/EQPreset.swift`
(the seven-band correction that every music preset builds on).

**Basis:** These filter values are **derived from third-party headphone measurements**,
not authored from scratch. They are the consensus of **three independent AutoEQ
parametric-EQ fits** for the Moondrop Chu II in-ear monitor toward the
**Harman in-ear 2019v2** target, all measured on IEC-711 / GRAS RA0045-class couplers,
from the community project:

- **AutoEq** by Jaakko Pasanen — https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq
  (AutoEq is licensed **MIT**; the aggregated measurement results are published under the
  repository's terms.)

The three measurement contributors averaged for the SesEQ baseline, as cited in
`Sources/EQPreset.swift`, are **HypetheSonics**, **Kazi**, and **Super Review**. SesEQ's
baseline is an **average/adaptation** of their published parametric fits, not a verbatim
copy of any single result file. The **Harman target curve** referenced is research by
Harman International / Sean Olive et al.; only the correction toward it (not the target
curve values) is embedded here. The per-genre deltas layered on top of this baseline are
the SesEQ author's own engineering judgment (first-party, MIT-licensed).

No measurement files, target-curve data files, or AutoEq source are redistributed —
only the derived filter coefficients embedded in `EQPreset.swift`. Product names
(Moondrop, Chu II) and target names (Harman) are used descriptively; no affiliation or
endorsement is claimed.
