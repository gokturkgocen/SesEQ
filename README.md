**A system-wide equalizer for macOS that listens to what you're playing and picks the right EQ curve for you — automatically.**

SesEQ is a lightweight menu-bar app that applies a real, transparent equalizer to your Mac's audio system-wide. It runs entirely on-device: it captures system audio through a Core Audio process tap, runs it through a native `AVAudioUnitEQ`, and plays it back through your real output device — no virtual audio driver, no kernel extension, no background service to babysit. When automatic mode is on, SesEQ figures out the genre of the current track and switches to a matching preset on the fly.

> The bundled correction baseline was measured and tuned for the **Moondrop Chu II** in-ear monitor, but that's just the default. SesEQ works with any headphones — every genre preset is a small delta on top of a single baseline curve you can treat as neutral, and the whole EQ is a set of standard parametric/shelf filters. Nothing about it is locked to one pair of earphones.

## Features

- **System-wide EQ** applied to all audio, not just one app.
- **Automatic genre detection** with per-genre presets — hip-hop, trap, EDM, drum & bass, R&B, pop, K-pop, rock, metal, jazz, classical, blues, latin, reggae, indie, ambient, and more (21 built-in presets in total).
- **Menu-bar only** (`LSUIElement`) — no dock icon; opens a compact SwiftUI popover.
- **Bilingual UI** — English by default, Turkish selectable at runtime from the settings panel.
- **Live spectrum analyzer** (2048-point FFT, 40 log-spaced bands) and a **rendered EQ response curve** for the active preset.
- **Genre-reactive UI**: the popover's accent color follows the active preset family (rock red, EDM blue, metal chrome, …) and animates on genre change.
- **Transport controls** (previous / play-pause / next) that route to whichever player is currently producing audio — Spotify, Apple Music, or YouTube Music.
- **On-device audio-content classifier** (a CoreML model) as a fallback when catalog lookups can't identify a track — nothing about your listening is sent anywhere for classification.
- **Smart device gating**: the EQ only engages on the built-in 3.5 mm headphone jack and gets out of the way everywhere else.
- A peak limiter at 0 dBFS sits after the EQ to catch any transient from an EQ boost.

## How it works

**Audio path.** SesEQ creates a global Core Audio process tap (`muteBehavior = .muted`) plus a private aggregate device. The tapped system audio is fed through an `AVAudioUnitEQ` node and played back to the real output device. Because it uses the public Core Audio tap API, there's no virtual driver or kernel extension to install.

**Where the EQ applies.** The EQ is active **only when you're listening through the built-in 3.5 mm headphone jack** (`transport = BuiltIn` and data source `hdpn`). On the built-in speakers, AirPods, any Bluetooth device, or a USB DAC, SesEQ automatically bypasses itself and leaves Apple's own DSP untouched. On Apple Silicon the speakers and the headphone jack share one device ID, so SesEQ watches the Core Audio data-source property to react correctly to plugging and unplugging.

**How it picks a preset.** For each track, automatic mode resolves a genre in this order:

1. **MusicBrainz** (primary) — community genre votes with counts, weighted into a preset family. Free, no API key. Accurate at the artist level where other catalogs mislabel.
2. **iTunes Search API** (fallback) — the track's primary genre, verified against the artist name to reject confident wrong matches.
3. **On-device CoreML classifier** (catalog miss) — when neither catalog can identify the track, SesEQ classifies from the audio content itself using a bundled model, independent of any catalog.
4. If everything else fails, it defaults to a pop preset.

Now-playing information comes from Spotify (Web API, with optional queue pre-fetch), YouTube Music (browser DOM), and Apple Music / browsers (AppleScript).

**The EQ curves.** Every music preset is a shared measurement-derived baseline plus a small genre-specific delta (a few dB at one or two points). The baseline targets the Harman in-ear 2019v2 response and is the consensus of three independent AutoEQ fits (all measured on IEC-711 / GRAS-class couplers against the same target). Presets use a negative preamp offset and apply no makeup gain, so the limiter rarely has to work — expect a small, intentional volume drop you can make up at the system volume. Speech / dialogue uses a separate intelligibility-focused preset rather than the music target.

## Requirements

- **Apple Silicon Mac** (arm64).
- **macOS 26.0 (Tahoe) or later** — the build target and bundle minimum are both pinned to 26.0.
- Xcode Command Line Tools with the macOS 26 SDK (to build).
- No Apple Developer account needed — see below.

## Download

Grab the latest `SesEQ-macos.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/gokturkgocen/SesEQ/releases), unzip it, and move `SesEQ.app` to `/Applications`.

The app is ad-hoc signed (no paid Apple Developer account), so macOS Gatekeeper will block it on first launch. To open it once:

**Easiest (Terminal):**

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/SesEQ.app
open /Applications/SesEQ.app
```

**Or via the GUI:** double-click `SesEQ` → when the warning appears, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **Open Anyway**.

You only need to do this once. Prefer to build it yourself? See below.

## Build & Install

SesEQ builds with plain `swiftc` — there's no Xcode project to open.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gokturkgocen/SesEQ.git
cd SesEQ
./build.sh install      # builds and copies SesEQ.app to /Applications
```

`./build.sh` alone just produces `build/SesEQ.app`; adding `install` also copies it to `/Applications`.

**Signing.** No paid Apple Developer account is required. If you have a local **Apple Development** signing identity (a free Apple ID provides one), the build uses it — re-signing with a stable identity keeps your macOS privacy (TCC) permission grants intact across rebuilds. If you have no signing identity at all, `build.sh` automatically falls back to **ad-hoc signing**, which needs no certificate. You can force a specific identity with `SIGN_ID="Your Identity" ./build.sh`.

**Regenerating the ML model (optional).** A normal build needs nothing from `ml-pipeline/` — the compiled model (`Resources/DiscogsEffNet.mlmodelc`) is already committed. See [`ml-pipeline/README.md`](ml-pipeline/README.md) to regenerate it from the upstream ONNX model.

## Permissions you grant once

The first time you use each feature, macOS prompts you. All are one-time grants:

- **Audio Recording** — required to capture system audio for the EQ. Audio is only processed and sent straight back to your output; it is never recorded to disk or transmitted.
- **Automation** for Spotify / Music / Chrome / Safari — used to read the currently playing track for automatic preset selection, and to send transport commands (previous / play-pause / next) when you use the playback controls.
- **Chrome only**: enable *View → Developer → Allow JavaScript from Apple Events* so SesEQ can read the YouTube Music player state.
- **Spotify pre-fetch (optional)**: connect from the settings panel by pasting a Client ID from your Spotify developer dashboard (redirect URI `http://127.0.0.1:38123/cb`). Tokens are stored in your macOS Keychain.

## Usage

1. Launch SesEQ — a menu-bar icon appears (no dock icon).
2. Click the icon to open the popover, then enable the EQ.
3. Plug in headphones via the 3.5 mm jack — the EQ engages automatically (and disengages on any other output).
4. Leave **automatic mode** on and SesEQ follows the genre of whatever you're playing, or pin the neutral baseline preset from the popover.
5. The popover shows the now-playing track, the detected genre and its source, a live spectrum, and the active EQ curve.

## Credits / Third-party

SesEQ bundles a third-party machine-learning model for on-device audio classification: **Discogs-EffNet** by **MTG-UPF** (Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra), from the Essentia model collection. The compiled CoreML model ships in `Resources/DiscogsEffNet.mlmodelc`, and the offline conversion pipeline lives in `ml-pipeline/`.
